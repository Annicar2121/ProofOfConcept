##UI Unity Scripts

This is a small collection of UI scripts used in various Unity projects.
They are somewhat disjointed, as they generally serve as small parts to a larger whole, but these suffice as
something of a proof of concept for coding in UI. 

IF you wish to see the project code as a whole, please refer to the related project folders for copies of the Unity Games
created in the UNM Advanced Game Development Course.
