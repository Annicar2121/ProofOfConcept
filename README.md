# Proof Of Concept

This repository includes a few coding projects from school, and a few done as hobbies. 
They are a proof of concept for coding, and should give you and idea how I approach programming.

The projects done in the Intellij IDE are full project folders, while the ones done in Unity have been stripped of everything but the script files. 

Most scripts/classes have comments littered throughout that desribe specif classes, attributes, and what each method does. 
There are also README files in each folder that should describe what the code is.
