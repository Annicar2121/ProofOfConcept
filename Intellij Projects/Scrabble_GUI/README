##Scrabble

A GUI based Scrabble game that draws the board and tiles as they are clicked, and features
a gameloop for triggering player/computer turns.

All classes have comments within them and above methods that describe and explain
what each does, and what components they rely upon. 

###Known Errors
This is not a fully functional game, the computer player was never fully
implemented. However the GUI works reasonably well, and this project is mostly
meant to demonstrate competence with UI and GUI interfaces.
